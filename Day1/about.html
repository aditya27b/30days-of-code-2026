                    <h3>🔧 Early Start (Age 11)</h3>
                    <p>
                        I started tinkering with Arduino and ESP32 microcontrollers at age 11. What began 
                        as making LEDs blink evolved into building line-following robots, obstacle-avoiding 
                        cars, and automated water dispensers. Those early projects taught me to think in 
                        systems—breaking complex problems into manageable steps.

                    <p>
                        During the COVID lockdown summer of Class 10, I started freelancing on Fiverr—not 
                        for money, but for interesting problems to solve. Over 3 months, I delivered 50+ 
                        automation solutions to clients across 15+ countries, from cryptocurrency trading 
                        bots to computer vision pipelines for Singapore's water infrastructure serving 
                        40,000+ users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This experience taught me what no tutorial could: how to translate vague requirements 
                        into technical solutions, scope projects realistically, handle production edge cases, 
                        and communicate across time zones and technical expertise levels.

                    <p>
                        During JEE preparation, I spent ~1,600+ hours building an AI-integrated IoT inventory 
                        management system. The project earned me National Finalist status in INSPIRE Awards 
                        MANAK (Department of Science & Technology, Govt. of India)—selected as 1 of 60 from 
                        350,000+ entries nationwide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I presented at Vigyan Bhavan, Delhi before DRDO scientists and industry experts. 
                        The evaluation session lasted 45 minutes when standard was 10-15 minutes. Did those 
                        1,600 hours cost me JEE marks? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely.

                    <p>
                        As a first-year ECE student at NIT Raipur, I found out about an internal hackathon 
                        24 hours before it happened. 15 teams, all seniors. We were the only first-year team. 
                        We qualified as top 2 and made it to Smart India Hackathon 2025 Grand Finals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Led my team to Grand Finalist status (Top 1%)—the only first-year team lead competing 
                        against final-year teams. We built Hacknest, an AI-powered livestock biosecurity 
                        platform that reduced disease detection from 7 days to 6 hours. The evaluator's words 
                        stuck: "So close. If we'd known you were first years earlier..."

                        I've learned to build systems that work in real-world conditions—not just demos 
                        that work on my laptop. Deployed computer vision pipelines that process images on 
                        resource-constrained hardware, built offline-first applications that sync when 
                        connectivity returns, and optimized MQTT protocols to achieve sub-200ms latency

                        more Stack Overflow, production bugs, and client feedback than textbooks—and I 
                        would not have it any other way. When documentation doesn't exist (like that TFT 
                        touchscreen that smoked out at midnight), I figure it out by reading source code 
                        and contacting library maintainers.

                        deliver under diverse cultural contexts. Built systems that serve rural Indian farmers

                <h2>Current Interests & Exploration</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm currently exploring <strong> hand writing synthesis </strong>, particularly 
                    conversion of digital text to humanlike handwritten text in real-time. Also diving deep into <strong>edge AI optimization</strong>—how do you run neural 
                    networks on microcontrollers with 520KB RAM? How do you compress models without sacrificing 
                    accuracy? These are the questions that keep me up at night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recently started experimenting with <strong>handwriting synthesis and neural networks</strong>, 
                    exploring how generative models can create realistic handwritten text. It's fascinating how 
                    the same principles that power large language models can be adapted to generate stroke-by-stroke 
                    handwriting patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond technical work, I'm active in <strong>NIT Raipur's ROBOTiX Club</strong>, where I'm 
                    learning from seniors and contributing to ongoing robotics projects. I'm also part of the 
                    <strong>  E-Cell</strong>, exploring how to take projects from prototype 
                    to product—because building something cool is only half the battle; making it accessible and 
                    sustainable is the other half.

                <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
                <p>
                    I believe in <strong>building systems that ship</strong>, not just impressive demos. A project 
                    that runs on your laptop is a toy; a project that runs on 40,000 devices in production is a 
                    system. The difference is handling edge cases, designing for failure, optimizing for constraints, 
                    and maintaining empathy for users who aren't software engineers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't wait for permission to build. At 11, I didn't ask if I was "ready" for Arduino—I just 
                    started. At 15, I didn't wait for someone to offer me internships—I found clients who had 
                    problems worth solving. At 18, I didn't let being a first-year stop me from competing at 
                    nationals—I just built something good enough to earn my spot.
                </p>

                    <strong>Curiosity compounds.</strong> That LED I made blink at age 8 led to Arduino projects, 
                    which led to freelancing, which led to national competitions, which led to here. Every project 
                    teaches you something that makes the next one possible. The key is to keep building, keep 
                    shipping, and stay curious about what's possible.
